- Overview of deep learning
- Neural networks and their architectures
- Keras and TensorFlow libraries
- Best practices for training models

## Deep Learning Techniques
- Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)
- Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)
- Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks

## Applications in Time Series
- Forecasting techniques
- Handling seasonality and trends
- Model evaluation metrics for time series
