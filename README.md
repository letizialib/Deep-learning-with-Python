## Introduction
In this project, I have compiled the most important insights from the book, focusing on the most important topics and those that can be effectively applied to time series data. This resource is intended for those who want to gain a deeper understanding of deep learning principles and their applications.

## Key Concepts
- Overview of deep learning
- Neural networks and their architectures
- Keras and TensorFlow libraries
- Best practices for training models

## Deep Learning Techniques
- Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)
- Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)
- Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks

## Applications in Time Series
- Forecasting techniques
- Handling seasonality and trends
- Model evaluation metrics for time series

## Installation
To get started, clone this repository and navigate to the project directory:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/letizialib/deep-learning-summary.git
